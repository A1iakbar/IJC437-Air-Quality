# IJC437 – Air Quality Analysis Project

This repository contains the individual coursework project for the **IJC437 – Introduction to Data Science** module.

The project focuses on **predicting and understanding PM2.5 air pollution in London** by analysing air quality sensor data from OpenAQ and meteorological data from Open-Meteo. The analysis follows a structured data science pipeline, including data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, statistical assessment, and predictive modelling.

## Research Questions

- **RQ1:** How do PM2.5 concentrations in London vary over time in terms of seasonal patterns and long-term trends?

- **RQ2:** How are meteorological conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, associated with daily PM2.5 levels?

- **RQ3:** To what extent can daily PM2.5 concentrations be predicted using historical PM2.5 values and meteorological variables?

## Data Sources

- **OpenAQ:** Daily PM2.5 air quality measurements from monitoring stations in London.  
  https://openaq.org/

- **Open-Meteo:** Daily meteorological data, including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.  
  https://open-meteo.com/

### Structure overview

- **code/**  
  Contains sequential R scripts corresponding to each stage of the analysis and directly linked to the research questions.

- **data/processed/**  
  Stores cleaned and integrated datasets used for analysis and modelling.

- **output/**  
  Contains all figures, tables, and log files generated by the scripts. Figures in this directory correspond directly to those discussed in the written report.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data acquisition:**  
   Daily PM2.5 data are retrieved from the OpenAQ API for monitoring stations within London.

2. **Data cleaning and integration:**  
   Air quality data are cleaned, validated, and merged with daily meteorological variables from Open-Meteo.

3. **Exploratory analysis:**  
   Time-series and seasonal analyses are conducted to examine temporal trends in PM2.5 concentrations (RQ1).

4. **Weather association analysis:**  
   Statistical and exploratory methods are used to assess relationships between PM2.5 levels and meteorological conditions (RQ2).

5. **Predictive modelling:**  
   Baseline and weather-enhanced models are developed to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations (RQ3).

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Open **RStudio** and set the working directory to the repository root.
3. Ensure **R (version 4.5.2 or later)** and the required packages are installed.
4. Run the scripts in numerical order:
   - `01_download_openaq_pm25.r`
   - `02_clean_merge_weather.R.r`
   - `03_rq1_time_trends.r`
   - `04_rq2_weather_association.r`
   - `05_rq3_prediction_models.r`
5. All outputs, including figures and tables, will be automatically saved to the `output/` directory.

## Notes on Reproducibility

- The repository structure clearly separates code, data, and outputs to support transparency and reproducibility.
- Scripts are designed to be run sequentially and include in-code documentation describing their purpose and outputs.
- Log files and session information are stored in the `output/logs/` directory where applicable.
