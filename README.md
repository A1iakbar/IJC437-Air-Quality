# IJC437 – Air Quality Analysis Project

**Module:** IJC437 – Introduction to Data Science  
**Programme:** MSc Data Science  
**Institution:** University of Sheffield  

This repository contains the individual coursework project for the IJC437 module. The project investigates temporal patterns, meteorological drivers, and the predictability of PM2.5 air pollution in London using open-access air quality sensor data and meteorological information.

The analysis follows a structured and reproducible data science pipeline, including data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical assessment, and predictive modelling, with a focus on interpretability and real-world applicability.

## Research Questions

**RQ1:** How do PM2.5 concentrations in London vary over time in terms of seasonal patterns and long-term trends?  

**RQ2:** How are meteorological conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, associated with daily PM2.5 levels?  

**RQ3:** To what extent can daily PM2.5 concentrations be predicted using historical PM2.5 values and meteorological variables?
