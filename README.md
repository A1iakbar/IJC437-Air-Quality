# IJC437 – Air Quality Analysis Project

**Module:** IJC437 – Introduction to Data Science  
**Programme:** MSc Data Science  
**Institution:** University of Sheffield  

This repository contains the individual coursework project for the IJC437 module. The project investigates temporal patterns, meteorological drivers, and the predictability of PM2.5 air pollution in London using open-access air quality sensor data and meteorological information.

The analysis follows a structured and reproducible data science pipeline, including data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical assessment, and predictive modelling, with a focus on interpretability and real-world applicability.

## Research Questions

**RQ1:** How do PM2.5 concentrations in London vary over time in terms of seasonal patterns and long-term trends?  

**RQ2:** How are meteorological conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, associated with daily PM2.5 levels?  

**RQ3:** To what extent can daily PM2.5 concentrations be predicted using historical PM2.5 values and meteorological variables?

## Data Sources

- **OpenAQ** – Daily PM2.5 air quality measurements from monitoring stations across London  
  https://openaq.org/

- **Open-Meteo** – Daily meteorological data (temperature, wind speed, precipitation)  
  https://open-meteo.com

The repository structure clearly separates code, data, and outputs to support transparency and reproducibility. Figures and tables generated by the scripts correspond directly to those discussed in the written report.

## Analysis Workflow

### Data acquisition
Daily PM2.5 data are retrieved from the OpenAQ API for monitoring stations within London.

### Data cleaning and integration
Air quality data are cleaned, validated, and merged with daily meteorological variables from Open-Meteo.

### Exploratory analysis
Time-series and seasonal analyses are conducted to examine temporal patterns in PM2.5 concentrations (RQ1).

### Weather association analysis
Statistical and exploratory methods are used to assess relationships between PM2.5 levels and meteorological conditions (RQ2).

### Predictive modelling
Baseline and weather-enhanced models are developed to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations under realistic forecasting conditions (RQ3).

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Clone this repository locally.  
2. Open RStudio and set the working directory to the repository root.  
3. Ensure **R (version 4.2 or later)** and the required packages are installed.  
4. Run the scripts in numerical order:
   - `01_download_openaq_pm25.R`
   - `02_clean_merge_weather.R`
   - `03_rq1_time_trends.R`
   - `04_rq2_weather_association.R`
   - `05_rq3_prediction_models.R`

All outputs, including figures and tables, will be automatically saved to the `output/` directory.

## Notes on Reproducibility

- Scripts are designed to be run sequentially and include in-code documentation describing their purpose and outputs.  
- The use of open-access data ensures that the full analytical pipeline can be replicated.  
- Outputs are written to disk to support non-interactive, reproducible execution.
